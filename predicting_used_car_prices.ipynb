    "For this project, I am using the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset is a collection of real-world used car listings from the popular automobile marketplace website https://www.cars.com. The dataset includes 9 distinct and informative feature variables that can be effectively used to predict a car's price.\n",
